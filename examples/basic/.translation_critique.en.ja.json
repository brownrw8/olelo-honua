The translation from English to Japanese is accurate and effectively conveys the original meaning. Here's a concise evaluation:

- **Accuracy**: All translations correctly reflect the original English phrases and terms. For example, "good_morning" is appropriately translated to the polite "おはようございます".
- **Nuances Considered**: The translator chose common and contextually appropriate terms. For instance, "taxi" as "タクシー" and "bathroom" as "トイレ" are widely understood.
- **Formality**: The translations maintain a polite tone suitable for general use, such as "たすけて" for "help" which is urgent yet appropriate.

**Minor Suggestions**:
- "さようなら" could be "さよなら" for a more common usage.
- "おげんきですか？" might use kanji as "お元気ですか？" in some contexts for standardization.

Overall, the translation is well-executed and effectively communicates the intended meanings.
